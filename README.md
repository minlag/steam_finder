This repository contains a program that interfaces with the Steam API to detect whether a player is online in a multiplayer Source Engine game. <br/>
It does this by querying all running servers asynchronously and checking the returned player lists.<br/>
It is able to check all 8000 running Team Fortress 2 servers in about 8 seconds, and can be configured on a per game basis.
